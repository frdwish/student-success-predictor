1. Title-->
Student Success Predictor: A Machine Learning and Analytics Approach

2. Executive Summary-->
This case study presents an end-to-end machine learning solution to predict student final grades (G3) using factors like study time, attendance, past grades (G1, G2), and parental education. 
The project integrates data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), RandomForest modeling, and an interactive Streamlit dashboard to visualize insights and predict outcomes.

3. Problem Statement-->
Student performance prediction is critical for identifying at-risk students and enhancing academic outcomes. 
Traditional assessment methods fail to provide early insights. This project leverages data-driven approaches to predict final grades and generate actionable insights for students and educators.

4. Data Overview-->
Source: UCI Student Performance Dataset
Number of Students: 395
Features:

(Feature)                (Description)
studytime	             Weekly study hours (1–4)
failures	             Number of past failures (0–4)
absences	             Total school absences
G1	                     First period grade (0–20)
G2	                     Second period grade (0–20)
Medu	                 Mother’s education (0–4)
Fedu	                 Father’s education (0–4)
traveltime	             Travel time to school (1–4)
G3	                     Final grade (target, 0–20)

5. Methodology--->
(Data Preparation)
   -Converted binary columns (yes/no) into numeric (1/0)
   -Removed outliers in absences using IQR
   -Selected relevant features for prediction

(Exploratory Data Analysis)
   -Histograms & Boxplots for numeric features
   -Correlation Heatmap to understand relationships
   -Scatter plots to explore studytime, failures, absences vs G3

(Machine Learning Model)
   -Algorithm: RandomForestRegressor
   -Split: 80% training / 20% testing
   -Evaluation Metrics:
      MAE: 0.97
      RMSE: 1.25
      R² Score: 0.85

(Deployment)
   -Built interactive Streamlit dashboard
   -Scaled G3 to 0–100 for better visualization
   -Included tabs for dataset preview, charts, scatter plots, and evaluation metrics

6. Key Insights-->
Strong correlation between G1/G2 and G3
Study time positively affects final grade
Students with past failures or high absences tend to have lower final grades
Dashboard allows real-time prediction and exploration of data trends

7. Dashboard Features-->
Sidebar Inputs: Study time, failures, absences, G1/G2, parental education
Prediction Tab: Shows final grade (0–100) for any student
Charts Tab: Histograms, scatter plots, boxplots, correlation heatmap
Evaluation Tab: Shows MAE, RMSE, and R² metrics

8. Conclusion-->
The project successfully demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning workflow to predict student success. The combination of predictive modeling and an interactive dashboard enables educators and students to identify improvement areas early, making it a powerful educational analytics tool.

9. Future Work-->
Include additional features like attendance trends, extra-curricular activities
Deploy on cloud (AWS, Heroku, or Streamlit Cloud) for global access
Add feature importance and interactive charts for better visualization
